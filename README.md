Case Study 3
Grace Robinson

The data that I looked at was information collected on customer visits to restaurants in order to focus on factors that drive customer satisfaction. The reason that I chose this data set is because I was interested in seeing what affects how satisfied people are when they attend a resturant. I always believe that age and income had a big affect of the satisfaction levels because I though that the older one got, the more critical they became and I also thought that the more money one had, the more harsh they would be cause they are used to nicer foods. My results from the data I collected that some of my assumptions were true and some were not.
My analysis begins by exploring the relationships between various factors influencing customer satisfaction, such as age, service rating, food quality, and ambiance. I also looked into how and if Income affected anything with satisfaction and it was revealed that Income does not have a significant impact on overall satisfaction.
An exploratory plot of Age vs. High Satisfaction reveals that younger customers generally report lower satisfaction scores. Logistic Regression plots of age against other variables like Service Rating highlight the area where improvements could make a significant impact on the increase of higher satisfaction ratings as the plot showed that there was a decline with age and service ratings. 
Another key finding is when looking at the Mean Satisfaction vs. Age Group plot shows that there is a slight incline in satisfaction as age increases. This suggests that specific demographics may require tailored services to boost satisfaction.
My problem statement is how can restaurants improve overall customer satisfaction by identifying key drivers? My initial hypothesis that I had is that customer satisfaction is influenced primarily by service quality, food quality, and ambiance. I also thought that age also plays a role. This is because I believed that different demographics have varying expectations. 
I used a random sample of restaurant satisfaction data to build logistic regression models. I did this in order to predict satisfaction levels and identify factors with the highest impact. The reason that I chose logistic regression is because it is effective for binary classification problems like predicting 'High Satisfaction' (1) vs. 'Low Satisfaction' (0). Logistic regression calculates the log odds of an event, satisfaction, as a linear combination of predictor variables. A sigmoid function maps these odds to probabilities. Key metrics like the Area Under the Curve (AUC) will evaluate model performance.
When looking at the results it can be seen that the logistic regression models highlight service rating as the most significant predictor of satisfaction. Adjustments to service processes may be the way to improve satisfaction. Insights from this analysis can help restaurants prioritize investments, such as training staff or upgrading menu offerings, to target areas with the most potential for boosting customer satisfaction.
The analysis employs logistic regression to predict customer satisfaction ('High Satisfaction' vs. 'Low Satisfaction'). This approach models the probability of a positive outcome as a function of predictor variables like Age, Service Rating, Food Rating, and Ambiance Rating. Binary columns for key variables, such as ServiceRatingBinary, FoodRatingBinary, and AmbianceRatingBinary, were created.
A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve evaluates model performance by plotting true positive rates vs. false positive rates. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) quantifies how well the model distinguishes between high satisfied and low satisfied customers. To validate the model's performance, a random baseline is compared, where satisfaction is randomly assigned. Since there is no significant gap between the AUC of the trained model and the random model, it shows that the predictors used are not meaningful.
The model achieves an AUC of 0.5303, indicating semi good performance. Service Rating has the highest coefficient, showing it is the strongest driver of satisfaction. By visualizing relationships and building a logistic regression model, this analysis uncovers actionable insights to help restaurants focus their efforts on factors that matter most to customers.
